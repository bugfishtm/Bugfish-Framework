Here are additional files not directly connected to the framework and not needed to run it. That are files i use for development to make my work faster.

This includes a dolibarr module to include my framework into dolibarr. If you use this module, be sure to read the readme file / the documentation for that module carefully, or you may get into software-trouble! :)
