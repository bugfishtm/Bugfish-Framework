# Free Website Template
Template to deploy fast backend or frontend webpages. 
Not much documented. See the Files and use my classes
and functions. In this folder is a websites template to build up a website with different functions  included in the framework. Its more for  internal purpose, more focus in this framework  is on the provided classes and functions. This  template should have the framework itself included  to work properly. But you can kee this section it  out of sight, im using it for fast deployment.

To use you need to include the repositories _framework folder into this folders _framework folder.

# Clarification

This is a Project i use for my personal development, to make things for me faster. There is nothing special about it and i do not think this area is of great interest for public use.
